##During my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I worked within the SQL domain, where I developed and strengthened my understanding of relational database management. My primary focus was on SQL joins, including inner joins, left/right outer joins, full joins, and cross joins. I gained hands-on experience in:
- Writing optimized SQL queries to retrieve data from multiple tables
- Understanding and implementing various join operations to solve business use cases
- Analyzing complex data relationships and ensuring query accuracy and performance
- Collaborating with the team to improve existing database queries and troubleshoot join-related issues
This experience helped me enhance both my technical SQL proficiency and my ability to work in a collaborative IT environment.
